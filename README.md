### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making a portfolio website.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [API documentation](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/) through idratherbewriting.com

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to contribute to open source documentation.

ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with using unsupported Jekyll themes with GitHub Pages (is it even possible?!?!)

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my dogs Jim and Frank.

ğŸ“« How to reach me: hello@iamcait.com

ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her

âš¡ Fun fact: Whales evolved from ancient deer-like animals!
